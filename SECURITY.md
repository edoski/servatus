# Security policy

Please report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub's security-advisory form for this
repository. Do not include sensitive paths, credentials, or research data in a public issue.

Only the latest released version receives security fixes.

Servatus is an unprivileged user library, not an authorization, sandboxing, tenant-isolation, or
cluster-policy layer. Its publication transaction protects against accidental partial visibility,
overwrites, and ordinary lifecycle races. Callers remain responsible for directory permissions,
trusted builders, application validation, filesystem guarantees, and scheduler policy.
